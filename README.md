# Description
This application is a YouTube clone. it utilizes [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hub) to fetch YouTube data. Also, I incorporated [Material UI](https://mui.com/) into this project and the reason for that is **1)** I wanted to try and learn a different styling technology  **2)** Material UI is easy to use and made my job easier.

**Features:** <br/>
1- The ability to search for a video similar to YouTube. <br/>
2- The ability to play any video.  <br/>
3- The ability to find any YouTube channel and access that channel to see the related videos. <br/>
4- The app is fully responsive to multiple devices.

# Tech Stack
- React <br/>
- Rapid API: This website contains tons of useful APIs from sports APIs to scientific ApIs you name it, it is there. <br/>
- Material UI: Very flexible library for styling and designing the user interface. One of the cool features that I loved about this library is that you can set styles for different devices using easy built in tags and useful pre-styled built in components that can be used anywhere in your app.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
